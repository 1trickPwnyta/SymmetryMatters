	<SymmetryMatters_LargeRoomCacheExpiryTicksDesc>Particularly large rooms are slow to calculate symmetry for. Therefore a cached value can be used. This setting determines how frequently, in ticks, the cache must be refreshed with a recalculated score. Setting to 0 disables this feature.</SymmetryMatters_LargeRoomCacheExpiryTicksDesc>
